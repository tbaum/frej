According to LGPL, with distribution of FREJ you should have its full sources
or assurance that you may access sources whenever you want.

I, Rodion Gorkovenko, as FREJ author and project administrator decided that
usually library users are not interested in its sources, especially if it is
used as command-line utility.

Due to this decision, sources are not included in distribution.

However if you are interested in FREJ sources, here I assure you that you
always could reach it via project's web-page.

While project is hosted on SourceForge, the best idea is to get sources
via standard SVN interface from FREJ repository. If you are developer, you
know your prefered way to do this.

If you are not a developer, I dare to advice you not to try to read or use
these sources because, though project is little and simple enough, its sources
are not very simple and very clear (it is very common with algorithms which
deals with text parsing). However you can access sources following links from
main web-page:

http://frej.sf.net

then click

"Project Info"

then click

"Code" / "SVN Browse"
